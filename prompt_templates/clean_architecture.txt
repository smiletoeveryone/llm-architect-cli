You're an expert software architect. I want to build a [project_type] in [language] using Clean Architecture.

Please generate:
1. A directory structure with the following layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Interfaces.
2. The entity and service logic for [component] (e.g., User/Auth).
3. REST interface definition using [framework] (e.g., FastAPI/NestJS).
4. Repository interface and test stub.

Use SOLID principles. Return code only.
